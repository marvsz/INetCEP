Improvements:

- I was checking out your implementation branch and ran it on my set of VMS but it didn't work for me.. 

- more queries in queryStore - at the moment it supports only one query, if there is another one it overwrites the earlier one (which should not be the case). 
Is it possible to implement a handle of multiple queries?

update ccn-lite and nfn scala and look if we still have the issue in precision? - implement the same in general for all queries (refer my centralized placement implementation) and update the precision calculation there - do the same in generic placement service. 
- how much time will it take to implement streaming in nfn?  
- how much time in fixing the operators implementation?
- remove all the disk IO and introduce static configuration (like java config) for static information - e.g., quick fix in reading placement utility weights and decentralized k hop information.



- by pass creating nfn queries and call the services directly- change in parsing--?
